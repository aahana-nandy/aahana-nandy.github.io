            <li> <strong>2020 U.S. Election Data Journey:</strong></li>
            In the Fall of 2024 I collaborated on a group project in my Information Ecosystems course taught by Dr. Leisya Palen. 
            <br>Through gathering a wide range of data from various sources related to the 2020 U.S. election, including voter turnout, <br>
            demographics, absentee/ mail-in voting, and more. By analyzing and combining these data points, we created a comprehensive<br>
            information flow that mapped how each data element contributed to the larger picture of the election process. <br>

            <li> <strong>The Information Work of the CU Ambassadors: </strong>. </li>
            In the Fall of 2024, my classmates and I conducted an in-depth ethnographic study of the CU Student Ambassadors, <br>
            the group that organizes all student tours on campus. We used a combination of interviews, observations, and other sources <br>
            to build comprehensive social world models of the organization. With these models and observations, we were able to break down<br>
            the organization's information workflow, and from there, we created a detailed data journey map that illustrated how all the <br>
            information flows and how data travels within the organization.<br>

        <ul>
           <li><strong>Resolution App:</strong></li>
            In the Spring of 2024, I collaborated with a team of students in the Designing Interactions course taught by Prof. Stephen Voida,<br>
            to design an app aimed at enhancing productivity and scheduling.The Resolution app is designed to help users maintain mental and physical <br>
            health by creating personalized schedules, setting reminders, and connecting with like-minded people. My role in the project involved<br>
             brainstorming key features such as the calendar and notification system, defining user personas, and conducting user research. I also <br>
             contributed to wireframes, user flows, and prototype refinement. Through collaboration, we developed a solution that makes it easier for <br>
             users to stay on track with their wellness goals while fostering community support.

        <ul>
           <li><strong>The Blossoming:</strong></li>
           In the Fall of 2024, I took on my first ever Design Challenge in the Design Foundations course taught by Prof. Joel Swanson. <br>
           With a movie genre and name assigned to me, I designed a murder documentary poster for the movie "The Blossoming", using original <br>
           photography and Photoshop.<br>

        <li> <strong>Reframing Portrait: </strong>. </li>
            In the spring of 2025, for my Image class with Professor Sheiva Rezvani, I created a collection of portraits for a Reframing Portraits project.<br>
             Given creative freedom for the assignment, I used my photography skills and photo-editing software to reframe the concept of a portrait.<br>
            Rather than photographing people, I captured various images of nature and edited them using softwares such as Lightroom to create a mystical, <br>
            vibrant, and unnatural look. The project culminated in a ten page book filled with these created portraits. I named the collection, "Dreamscapes," <br>
            where I blended different nature photos to transform their landscapes into a dreamier realm. I further personalized each piece by adding hand-drawn <br>
            doodles of flowers, moons, butterflies, and stars, which weave through each image and contribute to the collection's ethereal feel.<br>

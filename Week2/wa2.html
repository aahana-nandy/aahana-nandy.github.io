        <h2>The journey so far...(interests & passions)</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Aahana!! I am a passionate and driven student at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am majoring in Information Science with a minor<br>
        in Creative Technology and Design. I’m currently seeking a role in the UI/UX Design and Research field, where I can combine my 
        love for designing impactful <br>
        experiences with my curiosity about how people interact with technology.<br>
        <br>
        Growing up, I always loved any type of art and design. Whether it was sketching mermaids and princesses or building my very own Barbie dream house out of clothes 
        <br>and old cardboard boxes, my imagination knew no bounds. Although, my journey into design really began in high school, where I spent four years on my school’s 
        <br>yearbook staff, eventually climbing my way up to the Editor-in-Chief position my senior year. In that role, I led the creation of yearbook design layouts, helped 
        <br>craft the annual theme, and made key design decisions. I soon discovered how rewarding and fascinating it is to create something meaningful for others—how design 
        <br>can tell stories and shape how people connect with the world.<br>
        <br>
        From there, I found myself at CU Boulder where I’ve had the chance to expand this passion into the field of UI/UX design. Through various courses I have taken so far, <br>
        such as Designing Interactions, Design Foundations, and Information Ecosystems, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of human-computer interaction, as well as honed in <br>
        on my skills in user-centered design. Along the way, I also developed a fascination with user research and data analysis, exploring how information flows through systems <br>
        and how research insights can drive impactful design decisions. Just through a few courses I have taken in my early undergrad years, I have already found myself submerged <br>
        in the information science world. I am excited to explore what new interests and passions I’ll discover in the remaining years of my studies, and how the courses I take and <br>
        experiences I have will continue to shape my journey. <br>
        <br>
        Outside of academics, my interests in areas like forensic psychology and environmental sustainability influence the way I approach and think about design. I’m drawn to the <br>
        intersections of people, systems, and problem-solving—whether it’s understanding human behavior or addressing environmental challenges through thoughtful, accessible <br>
        technology. These passions fuel my creativity and shape how I approach projects with empathy and purpose.<br>
        <br>
        At my core, I have always been empathetic and creative. I love collaborating with others and finding ways to make technology more accessible and meaningful. I’m excited to <br>
        bring my skills, curiosity, passions and unique perspective to a team that shares my commitment to crafting impactful digital experiences.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s connect and design for the future together!<br></p>

                example: In the Spring of 2024, I collaborated with a team of students in the Designing Interactions course taught by Prof. Stephen Voida, <br>
                to design an app aimed at enhancing productivity and scheduling.The Resolution app is designed to help users maintain mental and physical health <br>
                by creating personalized schedules, setting reminders, and connecting with like-minded people. My role in the project involved brainstorming key <br>
                features such as the calendar and notification system, defining user personas, and conducting user research. I also contributed to wireframes, user <br>
                flows, and prototype refinement. Through collaboration, we developed a solution that makes it easier for users to stay on track with their wellness <br>
                goals while fostering community support.</li>

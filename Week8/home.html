            <p>Welcome to the Earth & Canvas Club, where our creativity is fueled by the beauty of the natural world around us. We are a community of artists and nature lovers who believe that the best studio is the one with no walls. 
            Our mission is simple: to connect with nature, with our art, and with each other!
            <br>
            <br>
            Each week, we explore a new, beautiful location. Trust us, there are plenty of spots all around us! Members bring their favorite supplies, whether it's a sketchbook and pencils or a full watercolor set, to capture the scenery around them or create new and original art.
            It's a welcoming space for all skill levels. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a curiou beginner looking to try something new, you are welcome!
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're searching for fresh inspiration, a reason to spend more time outdoors, and to find a supportive group of creative people, you've found your place. Join us to unwind, create, and see where your artistic adventure takes you!

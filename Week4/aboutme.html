        <p class="content-container">Hi, I’m Aahana!! I am a passionate and driven student at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am majoring in Information Science with a minorin Creative Technology and Design. I’m currently seeking a role in the UI/UX Design and Research field, where I can combine my 
        love for designing impactful experiences with my curiosity about how people interact with technology.<br>
        <br>
        Growing up, I always loved any type of art and design. Whether it was sketching mermaids and princesses or building my very own Barbie dream house out of clothes and old cardboard boxes, my imagination knew no bounds. Although, my journey into design really began in high school, where I spent four years on my school’s yearbook staff, eventually climbing my way up to the Editor-in-Chief position my senior year. In that role, I led the creation of yearbook design layouts, helped craft the annual theme, and made key design decisions. I soon discovered how rewarding and fascinating it is to create something meaningful for others—how design can tell stories and shape how people connect with the world.<br>
        <br>
        From there, I found myself at CU Boulder where I’ve had the chance to expand this passion into the field of UI/UX design. Through various courses I have taken so far, 
        such as Designing Interactions, Design Foundations, and Information Ecosystems, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of human-computer interaction, as well as honed in 
        on my skills in user-centered design. Along the way, I also developed a fascination with user research and data analysis, exploring how information flows through systems 
        and how research insights can drive impactful design decisions. Just through a few courses I have taken in my early undergrad years, I have already found myself submerged 
        in the information science world. I am excited to explore what new interests and passions I’ll discover in the remaining years of my studies, and how the courses I take and 
        experiences I have will continue to shape my journey. <br>
        <br>
        Outside of academics, my interests in areas like forensic psychology and environmental sustainability influence the way I approach and think about design. I’m drawn to the 
        intersections of people, systems, and problem-solving—whether it’s understanding human behavior or addressing environmental challenges through thoughtful, accessible 
        technology. These passions fuel my creativity and shape how I approach projects with empathy and purpose.<br>
        <br>
        At my core, I have always been empathetic and creative. I love collaborating with others and finding ways to make technology more accessible and meaningful. I’m excited to 
        bring my skills, curiosity, passions and unique perspective to a team that shares my commitment to crafting impactful digital experiences.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s connect and design for the future together!<br></p>

            <p class="content-container"> Looking into the future, I am very driven by a strong desire to become a UI/Ux Designer or Researcher. My passion stands in understanding people’s needs and translating those needs into meaningful and impactful designs.
                I am excited by the possibilities of creating intuitive and accessible experiences that could genuinely improve people’s lives and contribute to positive change in our world.<br></p>
            
            <p class="content-container">Along with future career goals and professional aspirations, my personal goals are
centered in global exploration and having a broader impact. I hope to travel the world and
immerse myself in different cultures and learn diverse perspectives. With this, I want to gain a
deeper understanding of unique challenges people face all around the world, with the overall
goal of creating solutions for different communities.</p>
